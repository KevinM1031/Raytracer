# Raytracer

An extension of a personal college project. A raytracing software was created from scratch using Typescript with the following features: placement of simple geometries, ambient lighting, diffusion lighting, specular lighting, reflections, jittering, custom sampling, point light source rendering, and area light source rendering.
